# Defects localization in images using deep learning-based classification with CAM output
This repository include code models used IDAACS'2023 conference article **'Defects localization in images using deep learning-based classification with CAM output'** by Rytis Augustauskas, Lukas Zabulis, ArÅ«nas Lipnickas, Simas Jokubauskas.

Modified image classficication architectures are used for with multihead output to predict and roughly segment image without pixel-wise annotation.

Check article for more details.
