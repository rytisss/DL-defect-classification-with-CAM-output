# Defects localization in images using deep learning-based classification with CAM output
This repository includes code models used in IDAACS'2023 conference article *'Defects localization in images using deep learning-based classification with CAM output'* by **Rytis Augustauskas**, **Lukas Zabulis**, **ArÅ«nas Lipnickas**, **Simas Jokubauskas**.

Modified image classification architectures are used with multihead output to predict and roughly segment images without pixel-wise annotation. It is making predictions in a single iteration.

The model is being trained as binary classified, then converted to a 2-output model in which one output is for classification score, the other for CAM explainability.

The following CAM explainability map (used for segmentation) can be generatated using this approach:
